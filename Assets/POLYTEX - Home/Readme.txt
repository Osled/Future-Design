Thank you for purchasing the POLYTEX - Home pack.

There are 89 prefabs.
Models are imported in fbx format.
Textures are from 512*512 - 2048*2048 png.

I used Unitys own Example Scene for URP as a template for lighting the scene. 
I tweaked Enviroment Lighting at Lighting settings.

I have added PTX in the end of fbx file names to make it easier to locate models.
